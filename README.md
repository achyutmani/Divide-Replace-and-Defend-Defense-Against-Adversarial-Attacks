# Divide Replace and Defend: Defense Against Adversarial Attacks
The method presentes a new technique to mitigate an impact of a dversarial attacks on image classification systems. The proposed framework combines concepts of bit plane slicing and conditional GAN to denoise the adversarial image crafted with adversarial attacks. The paper is under review for publication, reminaing scripts will be released after acceptance of the paper.
